title: "But mom, all the cool kids have a blog!"

It's the year 2019 and I finally got around to this new thing called "blogging".
After spending a lot of time thinking about it, *I'm now actually sitting here
writing my first post*.

I plan on writing mainly about software and whatever insights I will gather on my
technical journey. But who knows, maybe this totally derails and suddenly I write
posts about why it feels great to hone your straight razor with just one single whetstone.

To me it's about trying out new things that potentially could become a passion in my life.
So let's see if writing is something I enjoy doing.

Merry Christmas!
